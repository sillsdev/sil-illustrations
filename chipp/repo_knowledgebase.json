While it is possible to copy and paste label text into any of our map files, this is strongly discouraged.",
          "place_names_issue": "Place-names are notorious for being spelled inconsistently in minority language Scripture projects, because they are typically transliterations, and there are always multiple ways that Hebrew or Greek terms could be transliterated into any given language.",
          "solution": "The solution is to use either the Scripture Map Labeler plugin for Paratext (https://sites.google.com/sil.org/scripture-map-labeler/home), or its successor, the Paratext Diagram Labeler (tiny.cc/labeler). Both can generate data merge files for Adobe InDesign (IDML maps) and for Map Creator (MAPX maps).",
